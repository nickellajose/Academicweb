The data used in this analysis includes only games launched between the year 1980-2020.

**What genres were top sellers in the different regions?**

If we look across the regions we notice that action themed games appears to be the most popular.
Specifically in North America with approximately eight hundred seventy-eight million and EU with approximately five hundred and eighteen million,
this genre is uncontested in sales in comparison to the other genres in the same regions.
Other genres that are also popular in EU, Japan (JP) and North America (NA) are Shooter ,role playing and sports.

We can see the regional trends reflected in the global trend also , action games had over 1.7 billion sales globally,
followed by sports with about 1.3 billion and shooter type games with around 1.1 billion sales worldwide.

Another interesting regional trend to look at is the total sales by year of release.
Games released between 2006-2010 seems to have the highest total sales across regions,with peak sales being games released in 2008.
After 2008 in the NA and EU Regions there was a steep decline in total sales of games released after 2008.

Taking a closer look at the years 2004-2016 the action genre accounted for the highest proportion of games released among the genres.
